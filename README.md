# The-spark-foundation-DS--Task-1
#### **Description** : Predict the percentage of an student based on study hours **In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables. In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.**
